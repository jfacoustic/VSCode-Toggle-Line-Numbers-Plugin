# Line Number Toggle Plugin for VSCode

This is simply a plugin that allows you to toggle between different line number display types.

Each time you call it, it increments through the following:

1. off
2. on
3. relative
4. interval

Hope you find it useful! It definitely helps when you're using the VIM plugin.
